Hi i'm iggythepiggy and I want to be an ethical hacker.
I just made a github account so i'm still figuring things out, but I thought it would be cool to get feedback on what and how I should learn.
Right now I am learning on Overthewire bandit and am on level 22
I am learning python and if their are any cool projetcs you think would be good you can just tell me.
Also if you have any feedback about where and what I should learn you can also just let me know.
