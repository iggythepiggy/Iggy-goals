I am doing overthewire bandit and just created my first bruteforcer here is the code:

#!/bin/bash

password = "Not going to put the real password"

{
  for pin in $(seq -w 0000 9999); do 
     echo "$password $pin"
  done
} | nc loaclhost 30002

You can post your ideas/commenst in issues so let me know if it works and if you have any suggestions or projects to do next
